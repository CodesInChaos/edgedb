# The main EdgeQL grammar, all of whose productions should start with a
# GrammarToken, that determines the "subgrammar" to use.
#
# To add a new "subgrammar":
# - add a new GrammarToken in tokens.py,
# - add a new production here,
# - add a new token kind in tokenizer.rs,
# - add a mapping from the Python token name into the Rust token kind
#   in parser.rs `fn get_token_kind`
