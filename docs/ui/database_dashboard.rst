Dashboard
=========

The dashboard for each database displays the number of object types and
total number of objects contained within.

Besides this, the dashboard is simply a set of buttons leading to the
other parts of the UI (the REPL, Editor, Schema Viewer, and Data Viewer)
and some parts of the EdgeDB documentation that a new user will find
most useful.
